# Cremalink

Cremalink is a Python-based integration layer that connects compatible coffee machines to your automation and workflow stack, local-first, with optional cloud integration.

The goal is simple: make machine connectivity predictable, observable, and easy to integrate.

## What Cremalink is
1. A project that standardizes how you connect to and interact with compatible coffee machines
2. A foundation for automation workflows such as scheduled routines, dashboard integrations, and service orchestration
3. A developer-focused package, designed to be extended, tested, and maintained over time

## What Cremalink is not
1. Not an official manufacturer product
2. Not a UI-first consumer app
3. Not a promise of universal compatibility across all coffee machines

## Project status
Cremalink is under active development.
Public interfaces and documentation are intentionally minimal while the foundation is being stabilized.

## High-level roadmap
1. Define stable public interfaces and project conventions
2. Provide a minimal “getting started” path for local connectivity
3. Add optional cloud workflows and operational guardrails
4. Expand compatibility and documentation based on real device behavior

## Compatibility
Compatibility depends on device capabilities and connectivity model.
A clear compatibility matrix will be published once the baseline interface is finalized.

## Security and safety
Cremalink is designed with a conservative operational mindset: connectivity and automation should be explicit, auditable, and safe-by-default.
More detailed security notes will be added when the public interface is frozen.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome once the contribution guidelines are published.
Until then, feel free to open issues with device observations, reproducible problem reports, and feature requests.
